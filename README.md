# Maze Defender

This project is a tower defense game developed in Java using Swing, where you defend a maze from enemies that try to navigate through it.

This project is a learning exercise in implementing two new topics: A* pathfinding for enemy movement and Git for version control.

## Advanced topics
### A* Pathfinding
The goal was to implement this algorithm to allow enemies to move through a randomly generated maze. Enemies have a start and end point given, and calculate the optimal path using this.

We learned about this algorithm from online resources and programming tutorials, notably the A* Search Algorithm page by geeksforgeeks.org. This was our most important resource in learning how to implement this.

### Git
We used git for collaborative coding and version control to manage code changes and track progress. 

We learned how to use this from the GitHub "beginners guide to Git", and the Git Tutorial from w3schools.com.

Because of this, we were able to work on the project more efficiently and quickly.
